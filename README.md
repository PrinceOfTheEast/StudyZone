# StudyZone
Numerous software applications are available on several platforms which aim to aid students maximise their productivity when studying. They use known traditional techniques to provide features to accomplish this. These are generally used on smartphones due to its portability and convenience. However, most of these usually only specialise in single feature or two. Thus, students must use a combination of these applications to reach peak productivity. Hence, this outlined a clear opportunity for the development of an application which integrates all these common features as well as providing novel features based on research. StudyZone incorporates traditional features found on similar applications, but also includes novel elements such as a noise level measuerer. The released application runs on Android devices with an OS version 5.0 and above.
