Numerous software applications are available on several platforms which aim to aid students maximise their productivity when studying. They use known traditional techniques to provide features to accomplish this. These are generally used on smartphones due to its portability and convenience.

Hence, this outlines a clear opportunity for the development of an application which integrates all these common features as well as providing novel features based on research.
